# The `x-veld` defines the metadata section for a VELD. the `x-` is a necessity by docker compose as
# any key containing this prefix is ignored by docker compose
x-veld:

  # There are three VELD objects: data, exectuable, and chain. This here is a data veld.  Note that
  # if a data veld is defined, there is no need to define a `type: "files"` as a data veld is
  # assumed to be of this type
  data:

    # human stuff
    about:
      description: "example veld for testing and showcasing"

    # describes the format of the files of this repo
    format: "json"

    # content of the overall data
    content: "dummy data"

    # where to find it, necessary for a chain veld's mapping
